# MyFianlYearProject

## Project Introduction

    1. For ordinary users

‘World Recipes’ is a web application that has been created for this final year project. The purpose of this project is to create a web app that allows users to register and then login to upload their greatest recipes. This includes ingredients and step-by-step method, as well as images and timings to cook mouth-watering dishes. The recipes can be shared to their social media platforms that connect them to their friends and family. Users are also able to login and take control of their profile to edit their personal information, as well as uploading or editing their recipes. Comments and ratings are enabled for their recipes, however these options are only available whereby users have to be registered with the website to leave comments and ratings. Non-registered users can still enjoy viewing, following and sharing the recipes.

    2. For admins

This web app is not just for ordinary users to upload and share recipes on the front end of the system. Website admins are also able to login, take control and manage the backend of the system such as user data, as well as editing or deleting user accounts and recipes.

    3. MySQL database

In addition, a relational database is created to allow tables and the data within the tables to link together using foreign keys. This data can then cleverly be retrieved to display on the front-end of the website to interact with users. The product is a sophisticated system that have been programmed to meet user requirements on the front-end, as well as developed to ensure all the protocols connect together in the background to make the overall system function well.
